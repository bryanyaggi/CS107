Where the rolling foothills rise
Up towards mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
